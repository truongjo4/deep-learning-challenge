# deep-learning

This mini-project focused on the use of neural networks for a binary classification problem within a business context (i.e., whether to provide funding to companies).

### File Structure
- main.ipynb = script that contains initial data cleaning + the first neural network model created.
- AlphabetSoupCharity_optimisation.ipynb = contains script for subsequent neural networks created.
- Analysis.md = contains evaluation of the NN models.
- weights -> folder contains HDF5 file of the weights in the initial model.
- model -> folder contains both the initial and final models created in HDF5 format
